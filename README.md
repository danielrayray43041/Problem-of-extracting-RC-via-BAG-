# Problem-of-extracting-RC-via-BAG- 
Hi Ayan Biswas,
I am a graduate student from Taiwan and I use BAG to do research. 
I have seen your commits on ucb-art/framework about "Adding support for Calibre LVS + QRC extraction" on 26 Aug 2019 and revised all the codes you provided. However, it still doesn't work. 
I have gone to see the "bag_config.yaml" to check what is going on, and I find that it needs a "qrc_options.yaml" as a RCX runset file. Unfortunately, I can't find anywhere under the files downloaded from ucb-art and cadence cds_ff_mpt.
Therefore, I would like to ask if this is a key file to run it successfully.
If you have an instructions, please let me know.
Thanks a lot.
Appreciate
